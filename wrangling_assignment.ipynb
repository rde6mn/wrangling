What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",

        "  The five most common problems are: column headers are values instead of variable names, there are multiple variables in a column, varibles are stored in rows and in columns, there are many types of observational units in one table, and a single observational unit is in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in table 4 is messy because the variables are stored in rows and columns.\n",
